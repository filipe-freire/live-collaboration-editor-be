# 👨‍💻 Live Collaboration Editor!

## Introduction

This repo holds a dedicated Express backend built for a proof of concept app that aims to demonstrate a possible implementation of a live collaboration feature in a Rich Text Editor environment, through the Web Sockets protocol.

Built to be used with [this frontend](https://github.com/filipe-freire/live-collaboration-editor-fe/)

## 👩🏼‍💻 Development

This app was developed using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as its main package manager. However, running it with `npm` _should_ not break functionality.

1. Clone this repository;
2. Run `pnpm install` or `npm install` in the project's root directory;
3. `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev` to launch the server in development mode;
4. Run the [frontend](https://github.com/filipe-freire/live-collaboration-editor-fe/) mentioned above;
5. Profit! 💰
